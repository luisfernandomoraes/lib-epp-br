About This Software
-------------------

This is the LIBEPP-NICBR C++ library that partially implements the
Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), as described in the Internet
drafts RFC3730bis to RFC3734bis and RFC3735.

RFC3731bis - EPP Domain Name Mapping - was implemented with hosts as
attributes of the Domain Object.

In order to conform to the .BR model, extensions to the EPP Domain
Name and Contact Mapping were made (draft-neves-epp-brdomain and
draft-neves-epp-brorg), supported since version 0.2. The documentation
for these extensions is available at EPP References.

The source code was developed on FreeBSD 5.4 with gcc 3.4.2.

Although most of the development was made on FreeBSD, we found no
problems compiling the library and running the tests on Linux (tested
on Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 and on Ubuntu Linux 5 and 6). Starting from
version 1.5 of the library we were also successful in compiling it on
MacOS X 10.4.

Restrictions
------------

- This release does not implement the transfer and delete commands for
  any object, nor it implements RFC3732bis - EPP Host Mapping.

- Certificate validation not available.


Known Issues
------------

- Environment is assumed to set "ISO8859-1" as character encoding. The
  absence of this setting can cause some tests to fail.
  e.g.: LANG=en_US.ISO8859-1.

- The libepp-nicbr might not work as expected with OpenSSL 0.9.8 or
  greater versions.
